Boom Game Evolution

Boom Game Evolution is a simple 2D game where a neural network agent learns to reach a goal while avoiding bombs. The agent adapts over time using neural network and evolutionary principles to improve its performance.
Features

    Reinforcement Learning: Agent learns strategies to reach goals while dodging obstacles.
    Genetic Algorithm: Uses evolutionary techniques for optimization.
    Obstacle Avoidance: Agent dodges randomly generated bombs.

Dependencies

    pygame
    numpy
    random
    deap

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash
